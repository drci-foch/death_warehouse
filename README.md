## Project Description üè®

This Django web application is designed to facilitate the updating of patient death records for H√¥pital Foch. The system fetches data from INSEE (the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) to provide a reliable source of information for medical professionals and researchers. Once the data is processed and updated, it is automatically synchronized with the Oracle database of H√¥pital Foch.
